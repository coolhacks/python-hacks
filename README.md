# What is python ?

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code 
than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale
